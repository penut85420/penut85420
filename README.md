Here are some of my important works!

## [FriesMeowDiscordBot](https://github.com/penut85420/FriesMeowDiscordBot)
FriesMeow is a Discord bot made with my best cat - Fries! Well, she didn't push commits to this repo, but she provides many pictures to this bot. This command bot will randomly send you pictures of Fries, and even draw a tarot card for you!

A Yuanta Quote API program using python, which can collect the transaction details of the Taiwan stock, future, and option.

## [OpenRelic](https://github.com/penut85420/OpenRelic)
OpenRelic is my final project of java programming, which is a management system of a video game - Warframe. But after years the features of this program have been built into the game.

## [CopyTranslate](https://github.com/penut85420/CopyTranslate)
This is a lightweight and convenient cli tool that can help you translate when you are reading, you only need to copy, and the program will auto translate it for you.
