I love to code, I love to share. Graduated from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, National Taiwan Ocean University. Interested in machine learning, information security, financial technology, and competitive programming. Have experiences in the development of command bot, command-line tool, backend, simple website, and desktop GUI program.

Here are some of my important works!

## [FriesMeowDiscordBot](https://github.com/penut85420/FriesMeowDiscordBot)
This is a Discord bot made with my best cat - Fries! Well, she didn't push commits to this repo, but she provides many pictures to this bot. This command bot will randomly send you pictures of Fries, and even draw a tarot card for you!

## [ALGS-Fan](https://github.com/penut85420/ALGS-Fan)
This is a series of bots made for ALGS Studio, which is a StarCraft II broadcast team of Taiwan. There are the Twitch version and Discord version. The purpose of this bot is to query the date and time of StarCraft II match events and tell the viewers the left time of the next event.

## [CopyTranslate](https://github.com/penut85420/CopyTranslate)
This is a lightweight and convenient cli tool that can help you translate when you are reading, you only need to copy, and the program will auto translate it for you.
